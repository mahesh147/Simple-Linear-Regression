# Simple-Linear-Regression from scratch

A simple python program that implements Linear Regression on a sample dataset. The program only uses numpy and other basic libraries, Here in this we implement the whole linear regression on single variable using oops in python.

You can select your own learning rate and your own epochs to train the model, and after training it will plot the error vs epochs graph.
